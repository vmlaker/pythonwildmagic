Python Wild Magic
=================

The Python wrapper of Geometric Tools' Wild Magic C++ library.

To find out more, take a look at the documentation at http://vmlaker.github.io/pythonwildmagic.

Python Wild Magic uses David Eberly's Wild Magic code from `Geometric Tools <http://www.geometrictools.com>`_.

June 18, 2022 update: Wild Magic is not maintained any more, and the inventor had replaced it with a more advanced `Geometric Tools Engine <http://github.com/davideberly/GeometricTools>`_. You'll have to do some retooling to build using Geometric Tool's latest code.
