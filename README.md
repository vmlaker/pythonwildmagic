# Python Wild Magic

The Python wrapper of Geometric Tools' Wild Magic C++ library.

To find out more, take a look at the documentation at
http://vmlaker.github.io/pythonwildmagic.


***Python Wild Magic uses David Eberly's Wild Magic 5 source code.
Once available from [Geometric Tools](http://www.geometrictools.com),
it is since no longer maintained. The inventor replaced Wild Magic
with the more advanced
[Geometric Tools Engine](http://github.com/davideberly/GeometricTools).
You'll have to do some retooling to build the Python wrapper
of the latest code.***
